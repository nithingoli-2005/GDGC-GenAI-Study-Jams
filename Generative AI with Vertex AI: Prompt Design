Generative AI with Vertex AI: Prompt Design
‚òÅÔ∏è Overview

This lab delves into prompt engineering best practices to enhance the quality of responses from large language models (LLMs) like Gemini. 
By focusing on crafting clear, specific, and well-defined prompts, you'll learn techniques to guide the model's behavior, reduce output variability,
and improve response accuracy. The lab emphasizes the importance of structuring prompts effectively to achieve desired outcomes.
