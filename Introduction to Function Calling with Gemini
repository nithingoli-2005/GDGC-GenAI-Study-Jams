‚òÅÔ∏è Overview

Function calling allows developers to define descriptions of functions in their code and pass them to a language model within a request. 
The model‚Äôs response will include the name of a function and the arguments to call it with, in a structured format (JSON). In this lab, you‚Äôll learn 
how to use Gemini via Vertex AI to generate function calls from natural language prompts, then use or interpret those calls to perform structured tasks like 
querying product data, geocoding, or entity extraction.

üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

Install and use the Google Gen AI SDK for Python to work with Gemini API. 

Generate structured function calls from natural language prompts using the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. 

Use function calling for real-world tasks like:
‚ÄÇ ‚Ä¢ Responding to Google Store queries by defining function signatures and prompting the model to call them 

‚ÄÇ ‚Ä¢ Geocoding addresses by generating function calls that include parameters for external API calls (e.g. latitude/longitude) 

‚ÄÇ ‚Ä¢ Extracting entities from unstructured text (e.g. logs) using function calling 

Understand how to interpret model outputs (function name + arguments) and integrate them into your application workflow.

üß™ Hands-on Labs
Lab	Description
1. Setup & Initialize Environment	Prepare your Google Cloud project, configure APIs, and initialize the working environment.
2. Build & Test Core Functionality	Develop the main logic or application feature(s) and test locally or in Cloud Shell.
3. Add Advanced Features / Integration	Integrate additional services or features (e.g. external APIs, auth, UI components).
4. Containerize & Deploy	Package your application (e.g. with Docker), push to a registry, and deploy to a managed compute service.
5. Validation & Cleanup	Test the deployed app‚Äôs functionality end-to-end, verify requirements, and clean up resources.

üß∞ Technologies & Tools Used

Google Cloud / Vertex AI (to host and call Gemini models) 

Gemini API / Gen AI SDK for Python (to interact programmatically with Gemini) 

Jupyter notebook / Vertex AI Workbench environment (for running the lab steps) 

Python (for scripting, defining function signatures, processing JSON, etc.) 

External APIs (e.g. geocoding service) for functional examples (e.g. converting address ‚Üí lat/lon)
