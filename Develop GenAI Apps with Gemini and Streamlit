‚òÅÔ∏è Google Cloud Skills Boost ‚Äî Develop GenAI Apps with Gemini and Streamlit: Challenge Lab
üß≠ Overview

This is a challenge lab (rather than a guided lab) in which you‚Äôre given a scenario and a set of tasks to complete on your own. 
You are expected to apply your existing skills with Google Cloud, generative AI, and Streamlit to build, test, and deploy a GenAI-based application using the Gemini model. 
An automated scoring system will validate your task completion.

üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this challenge lab, you will demonstrate your ability to:

Use cURL to test prompts with the Gemini API endpoint. 

Write a Streamlit front-end application (in Python) to collect user inputs and call Gemini with dynamic prompts. 

Test the Streamlit application in the Cloud Shell environment. 

Build a Docker image, push it to Artifact Registry, and configure the Dockerfile to use your application code. 

Deploy the application to Cloud Run, and test that the deployed web app works as intended.

üß™ Hands-on Labs
Lab	Description
1. Use cURL with Gemini API	Test the Gemini API endpoint using cURL to send prompts and verify AI-generated responses.
2. Develop Streamlit Application	Build a Streamlit-based GenAI web app (chef.py) that takes user inputs like cuisine, diet, ingredients, and wine preference to generate meal recommendations using Gemini.
3. Test Application in Cloud Shell	Run and verify the Streamlit app inside Google Cloud Shell using a Python virtual environment and dependencies.
4. Dockerize & Push to Artifact Registry	Containerize the Streamlit app with Docker, build the image, and push it to Google Artifact Registry for deployment.
5. Deploy to Cloud Run	Deploy the containerized application to Cloud Run, configure environment variables, and test the live GenAI web app through its service URL.
