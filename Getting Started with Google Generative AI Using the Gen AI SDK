‚òÅÔ∏è Overview

This lab introduces the Google Gen AI SDK for Python as a unified interface to work with Google‚Äôs generative AI services and models (including Gemini). 
You‚Äôll learn how to set up the SDK, send different kinds of prompts (text, multimodal), control the model‚Äôs behavior, and experiment with advanced features 
like function calling, token counting, context caching, and embeddings.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

Install and initialize the Gen AI SDK in a Python environment. 

Connect and authenticate to Google‚Äôs generative AI services and models. 

Send text and multimodal prompts (e.g. with images, audio) to a model and fetch responses. 

Configure model parameters (temperature, max tokens, safety filters) and system instructions to guide generation. 

Manage model interactions:
‚ÄÇ ‚Ä¢ Multi-turn conversations / streaming responses 

‚ÄÇ ‚Ä¢ Send asynchronous requests 

Use function calling features: define structured function signatures and have the model output function calls. 

Use context caching to reuse parts of the conversation or prompt efficiently. 

Run batch predictions: send many inputs at once and process outputs asynchronously. 

Generate text embeddings for given content

üß™ Hands-on Labs
Lab	Description
1. Set Up the Environment	Initialize your working environment in Vertex AI Workbench or Cloud Shell. Install the Gen AI SDK for Python and configure authentication to access Gemini models.
2. Send Text Prompts	Use the SDK to send simple text-based prompts to the Gemini model and display the generated responses. Adjust parameters like temperature and max output tokens.
3. Work with Multimodal Prompts	Send inputs that include text + image or text + audio, demonstrating Gemini‚Äôs multimodal understanding and generation capabilities.
4. Configure System Instructions	Modify model behavior by adding system-level instructions that guide the response style, tone, or format.
5. Implement Function Calling	Define function schemas in Python and have the model generate structured JSON function calls. Use the results to trigger functions programmatically.
6. Use Context Caching	Experiment with context caching to store parts of the conversation or shared context and reuse them efficiently across prompts.
7. Run Batch Predictions	Send multiple prompts simultaneously using batch processing for large-scale inference or offline data generation.
8. Generate Text Embeddings	Use the SDK‚Äôs embedding feature to convert text into vector representations for similarity search, clustering, or semantic understanding tasks.
